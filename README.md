Identify an individual through different social network services

This work aims to address the cross-SNS (social networks services) user identification problem. We'll investigate the correlation between usernames on different SNS connecting real individuals, based on behavioural patterns user displayed while selecting their usernames and the information redundancies generated.

I set up an API on Mashape based on this work.
